      <description>I have been trying to write this intro for the past month now but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to write anything satisfactory, so this is pure stream of consciousness.
I&amp;rsquo;m setting up this journal to record my thought processes as I develop some apps for my own personal use. Hopefully it may prove useful to someone out there. At the very least, it should serve as a reminder of the mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ll make and any lessons I learn.</description>
