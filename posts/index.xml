      <description>There&amp;rsquo;re billions upon billions of very well made themes for Hugo out there, so it&amp;rsquo;s a huge waste of my time to even attempt writing my own. Time that can be well spent working on Budgeteer or SnowboardGP or Kutsurogi or Okra or Libraga, and so on. I have so many ideas, all of them barely touched upon.
 I DO NOT HAVE THE THE TIME TO WRITE MY OWN THEME!</description>

      <description>I have been trying to write this intro for the past month now but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to write anything satisfactory, so this is pure stream of consciousness.
I&amp;rsquo;m setting up this journal to record my thought processes as I develop some apps for my own personal use. Hopefully it may prove useful to someone out there. At the very least, it should serve as a reminder of the mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ll make and any lessons I learn.</description>
