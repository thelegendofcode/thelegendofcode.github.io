<p>Projects I&rsquo;m actively working on.</p>

<h3 id="1-legend-of-code">1. Legend of Code</h3>

<p>This very blog you&rsquo;re looking at, if you even exist. Hi there!</p>

<h3 id="2-budgeteer">2. Budgeteer</h3>

<p>Something to plan budgets with, but not really. Maybe more of a networth visualiser. This is based on a patchwork of various code snippets and SQL scripts I&rsquo;ve cobbled together over the years so I could check my current liquidity and put together a rough budget. Doesn&rsquo;t work very well because it requires too many manual steps.</p>

<p>So yes, it is used to plan a budget. But what it actually does is just create a visualisation of my assets and liabilities. I should probably do some needs gathering and properly define whatever the hell it is I want to build. It&rsquo;s probably multiple projects in one because it originally stemmed from a RECORD-ALL-THE-THINGS! kind of project that was equally as well defined and definitely didn&rsquo;t suffer from scope creep or anything.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t intend to monetise or sell this thing so it is basically my little tech playground.</p>

<h3 id="3-snowboardgp">3. SnowboardGP</h3>

<p>Essentially my snowboarding blog but is something I think has a slight chance of generating some side income.</p>

<p>Essentially a simple visual map of all the ski resorts in Japan and a trip planner. Changes to the Google Maps pricing has complicated things a little.</p>

<p>Just a little.</p>

<h3 id="4-kutsurogi">4. Kutsurogi</h3>

<p>Home refactoring project. I should probably blog about it.</p>

<h2 id="icebox">Icebox</h2>

<p>Stuff that&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve stopped working on for now.</p>

<h3 id="5-okra">5. Okra</h3>

<p>Dashboard and visualisations for OKRs</p>

<h3 id="6-libraga">6. Libraga</h3>

<p>Static site generator with a CMS. Something I made to learn nodejs. Never finished, probably never will.</p>

<h3 id="7-gitsee">7. GitSee</h3>

<p>Git GUI - A git that you can see.</p>
