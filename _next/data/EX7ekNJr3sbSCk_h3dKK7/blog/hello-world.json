I plan to document the design and build as I go.</p>\n<p>Progress will probably be slow.</p>\n<h2>Let's quickly talk about the tech stack.</h2>\n<p>Previous versions of this website were built using static site generators like <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"https://wintersmith.io\">Wintersmith</a>, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io\">Hugo</a>, etc. Probably more but these were the ones I remembered. These all failed for various reasons: lack of skill, lack of motivation, insufferable documentation, lack of planning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This time it's different!â„¢</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This time, I'm using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">Next.js</a>, something I'm already using everyday at $DAY_JOB. I've also separated my tasks where instead of designing and coding all at once, I started off with a basic design before even typing <code>git init</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mdxjs.com\">MDX</a> seems to be popular for Next.js based blogs but I've decided to stick with plain markdown to keep a clear separation of concerns between code and content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">GitHub Pages</a> is where I'm currently hosting this. I might move it elsewhere later once it's more developed.</p>\n<p>Everything else is still in flux. One thing at a time.</p>\n<p>See you again! ðŸ‘‹</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
