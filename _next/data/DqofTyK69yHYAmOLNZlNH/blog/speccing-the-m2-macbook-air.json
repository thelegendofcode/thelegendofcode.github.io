{"pageProps":{"article":{"data":{"title":"Speccing the M2 MacBook Air","date":"2022/06/08","description":"Musing about what specs to order","series":[],"tags":["stream of consciousness"],"categories":[]},"content":"<p>The new M2 MacBook Air has just been announced and I intend to get one to replace my 2017 Retina MacBook.</p>\n<p>Usually, the simple thing to do would be to just max out the specs. However, I have been using my Retina MacBook for almost 5 years now together with a maxxed out 2018 Mac Mini as well as whatever MacBook Pro I sometimes get assigned at work.</p>\n<p>I know that I do not require max specs on this machine because it is mostly used when I'm out of the office.</p>\n<h2>CPU/GPU</h2>\n<p>There are 2 options here with only a single different, 8 core GPU or 10 core GPU. Both options offer an 8 core CPU and 16 core Neural Engine.</p>\n<p>I will not be gaming on this machine, I'm not editing videos. I onced did some work with WebGL but not anymore. Therefore the additonal 2 cores make little difference to me.</p>\n<h2>RAM</h2>\n<p>I don't run too many containers, but I've often got some kind of Windows VM going as well as Docker containers running various databases.</p>\n<p>I will max this out.</p>\n<h2>SSD</h2>\n<p>Now this is the surprising part. I had initially assumed 1TB would be perfect.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at my Mac Mini and it only had 512GB.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at my Retina MacBook and it only had 256GB, which was only half full.</p>\n<p>It looks like I'm perfectly fine with the smallest storage option available.</p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>The base spec M2 MacBook Air with max RAM looks like it'll meet most of my needs as I only use it while travelling. Most of my beef work will be done at the office on my 2018 (intel) Mac Mini. Speaking of which, I'll getting a Mac Studio Max to replace that too.</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
