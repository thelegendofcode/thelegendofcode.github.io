<p>Previous versions of this website were built using static site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://wintersmith.io">Wintersmith</a>, <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, etc. Probably more but these were the ones I remembered.These all failed for various reasons: lack of skill, lack of motivation, insufferable documentation, lack of planning.</p>

<p>This time, I'm using <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a> which is something I'm already using everyday at $DAY_JOB. I've also separated my tasks where instead of designing and coding all at once, I started off with a basic design before even typing <code>git init</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://mdxjs.com">MDX</a> seems to be popular for Next.js based blogs but I've decided to stick with plain markdown to keep a clear separation of concerns between code and content.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> is where I'm currently hosting this. I might move it elsewhere later once it's more developed.</p>
<p>Everything else is still in flux. One thing at a time.</p>
